# full_stack_code_imageupload
I have completed Image upload task which I had received last week. I have used React for Front End and Nodejs , Postman, MongoDB as backend. I am calling API using Axios and fetching data from mongo DB and Data is rendering over UI. Also did validation while uploading image as well.
